# Batuta

Batuta is a translation app for curious travelers.

Batuta can translate over a hundred languages, recognize text from images, identify objects, and pinpoint major landmarks.

Our appâ€™s namesake is Ibn Battuta, a Muslim scholar who lived 700 years ago. He made it all the way to China from Morocco. He was probably the most well-traveled human being who ever lived prior to trains and planes. We hope this app would have helped him on his journey.
